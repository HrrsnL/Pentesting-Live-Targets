# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43581439/78093303-ed82fb80-739f-11ea-840f-37b1f7538756.gif)

Entering "' OR SLEEP(3)=0--'" after "https://35.184.88.145/blue/public/staff/salespeople/show.php?id=" on red and green will show blank infomation while on blue it will show actual information on a certain person.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

[delete]

Using the session ID of a session that has already logged in for the blue session will automatically log the blue page in upon selecting login.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

[delete]

Entering a valid or invalid username such as the given "jmonroe99" will return the bolded message "Log in was unsuccessful." on the red and blue site. However, an invalic username on thegreen site will return the same message but unbolded.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

[delete]

Submitting "<script>alert('test');</script>" in the contact box will create an alert to pop up when a staff member access the feedback page. I was not able to get to my message because there was a redirect in one of the attacks. The XSS vulnerability is also exclusive to the green site.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

[delete]

Changing the id of the selected salesperson to a restricted number returns the attacker to the ssalesperson selection page for the green and blue sites while doing the same action on the red site takes the attacker to the restricted number.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[delete]

Changing the csrftoken to a bogus value in the green or blue site and then editing a user's data will be invalid while doing the same in the red site will keep the change.
